A blanket is comforting as we work from a far.
Below are the musings from learners of R:

I rather enjoy a hot cup of tea.
Drinking it fills my heart with such glee.

The weather is nice yet I stay in and code.
Does it count if the window is open to my abode?

Studying at home is my new thing, 
Learning in R will improve my skills.

My sleep schedule is shot.
But I still think I'll learn a lot.

Hoping to make GitHub my new friend,
Otherwise my grades will show a pretty sad trend.

Studying while drinking some coffee.
I do wish I also had some toffee.

As we prepare to ramp up for another semester,
I find my itch to roam begin to fester.

I can hear the clock ticking time,
as I try to write these lines.
